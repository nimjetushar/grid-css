Grid css for creating responsive web designs

## Basic understanding

The basic understanding for rendering grid is the sumation of the used columns which should always be eqaul to 12.
Consider rendering grid using class ```.col-4 .col-6 .col-2 ```. In this sample the summation is ``` 4 + 6 + 2 = 12 ``` so the grid would render properly. So always take care column sumation.

For more reference refer ``` /docs ```.

This grid system is build with reference to bootstrap.
